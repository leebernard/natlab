"""
This script is for comparing the spectrum access of IGRINS vs a balloon platform, with the goal of determining the
potential benefits of having access to the opaque windows in Earth's atmosphere.

The idea is that water is of high interest to exoplanet science. Unfortunately, Earth's atmosphere is opaque in the
majority of water spectral features, making those features unavailable to the large, ground-based high-resolution
spectrographs that are the current state-of-the-art. This script will quantify how spectral information would be gained
by moving IGRINS to a balloon platform.

For now, teat only water species
